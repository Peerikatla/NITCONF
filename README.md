<!-- ## System Features
This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the most logical sense for your product.
### 4.1 System Feature 1
Don’t really say “System Feature 1.” State the feature name in just a few words.
4.1.1   Description and Priority
 Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).
4.1.2   Stimulus/Response Sequences
 List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements associated with use cases.
4.1.3   Functional Requirements
 Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature. These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case. Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary information is not yet available.
 
 Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a meaningful tag of some kind.

### 4.2 System Feature 2 (and so on)






## Other Nonfunctional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
System is designed to help reviewers review papers assigned to them. It involves the dynamic process of paper-review management with efficiency and precision. Some important functionalities of the reviewer include accepting/rejecting/editing/deleting/declining/accept upon further revision.
   #### Response time and efficiency
   system will respond in less than a second of submitting the request. Tasks like viewing his/her/their reviewed papers history might take some extra seconds but the overall performance will be fast and efficient.
   Can use a mix of Server side rendering for the intial load of the page for better SEO (search engine optimization) and then Client side rendering for dynamic interactions.


### 5.2 Safety Requirements
The system will store all the data in a secure database. The reviewers will be able to view information but will not have the privilege to modify/edit it if the PC chair has already processed it. This privilege will be given to the PC committee and only they have the right to update the database. These are the two different types of accessors and have varying access constraints.
In terms of the safety aspect, the system does not pose a threat to its users. To combat attacks by malware, backing up the database is advised.

### 5.3 Security Requirements
Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.
### 5.4 Software Quality Attributes
Specify any additional quality characteristics for the product that will be important to either the customers or the developers. Some to consider are: adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, such as ease of use over ease of learning.
### 5.5 Business Rules
List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional requirements to enforce the rules.

## Other Requirements
Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections that are pertinent to the project.
### Appendix A: Glossary
Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to a single project in each SRS.
### Appendix B: Analysis Models
Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship diagrams.
### Appendix C: To Be Determined List
Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure. -->
